In Geo-Consulting I was involved in many
activities like poc development, software
analyst, design software architecture and
so on. The more valuable product
developed was a transaction manager for
SAP. It was developed on top of the official
SapJCo, this module was the foundation
for almost all integration projects
between SAP and the external “World”
like Alfresco, Magento and custom
systems. I was also the technical
leader/coach for all the new junior
engineer hired in the company.
